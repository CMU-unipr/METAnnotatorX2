DESCRIPTION

METAnnotatorX2 is a bioinformatic platform for reads- and assembly-based 
analysis of metagenomics datasets. This pipeline allows the perform taxonomic
and a range of functional profiling analyses of next-generation shotgun 
sequencing data. Shotgun metagenomics datasets can also be assembled and the
resulting contigs can be taxonomically classified at the genus or species 
level with the generation of GenBank files with annotated ORFs for each taxon 
identified. Contigs corresponding to each genus or species profiles can also 
be functionally characterized.


Change log


Version 2.6.5, 20 December 2022
- Corrected a bug and improved settings in parameters file for the rarefaction curves generation.

Version 2.6.4, 14 December 2022
- Added generation of rarefaction curves in the parameters files in addition to eXtra random features.

Version 2.6.3, 05 December 2022
- Added function for additional eXtra random features: rarefaction_curves. It performs rarefaction curves of the number of detected species using 10 subsets of reads with hits.

Version 2.6.2, 21 July 2022
- Corrected and error in the extraction of taxonomic profiles of EC genes of the additional eXtra random features: extractor.

Version 2.6.1, 04 July 2022
- Added the host filtering option: Apis mellifera

Version 2.6.0, 29 June 2022
- The eXtra random features go_hierarchy is now a main feature that can be requested in the parameters file. It performs a GO hierarchical classification of EC numbers listed in the database provided in the database sub-folder "METAnnotatorX2/databases/Metabolic_reactions/Diamond_is_unbreakable/ECtoGO". Present version includes EC numbers involved in small molecules metabolism. Database will be extended to all enzymatic reactions in a future update.

Version 2.5.7, 14 June 2022
- Added function for additional eXtra random features: go_hierarchy. It performs a GO hierarchical classification of EC numbers listed in the database provided in the database sub-folder "METAnnotatorX2/databases/Metabolic_reactions/Diamond_is_unbreakable/ECtoGO". Present version include sEC numbers involved in small molecules metabolism.

Version 2.5.6, 06 June 2022
- Updated the additional eXtra random feature: extractor.

Version 2.5.5, 06 May 2022
- Added function for additional eXtra random features: extractor. It check presence of the EC_list_for_taxonomic_profiling.txt file in samples folders and merges results of all the samples based on EC number.

Version 2.5.4, 26 Apr 2022
- Added function for additional eXtra random features: ec_taxonomy. It performs taxonomic profiling of reads classified as specific EC numbers as listed in the EC_list_for_taxonomic_profiling.txt. An example is availabile in software/additional_resouces and should be put in the root analysis directory.

Version 2.5.3, 20 Apr 2022
- Added update of dependeciens when updating software.

Version 2.5.3, 24 Mar 2022
- Added automatic detection of reads lenght for kmer settings of assembly.
- Added additional information regarding taxonomically and functionally classified reads in the sequencing_and_quality_filtering_stats.txt file.
- Improved the additional eXtra random feature "extractor" to match the new sequencing_and_quality_filtering_stats.txt format.
- Corrected an issue in the eXtra random features: prepare_miseq, prepare_nextseq, prepare_single.

Version 2.5.2, 08 Mar 2022
- Corrected an issue in the EC classification script of reads and genbanks.
- Improved the function for additional eXtra random features: prepare_miseq, prepare_nextseq, prepare_single.

Version 2.5.1, 22 Feb 2022
- Corrected an issue in the LCA taxonomic classification script.
- Updated the installer to include "curl" software.

Version 2.5.0, 09 Feb 2022
- Species and genera level GenBank generation and functional annotation of the predicted genes has been revamped employing Diamond software and a novel non redundant (processed with CD-HIT 0.7 identity) RefSeq database.

Version 2.4.2, 08 Feb 2022
- Added progress report for reads classification.

Version 2.4.1, 07 Feb 2022
- Added function for additional eXtra random features: extractor.
- Functional analysis based on EC number profiling was totaly renewed based on Diamond software for ultrafast blastx and a new non redundant (processed with CD-HIT 0.8 identity) database of prokaryotic genes with EC number based on RefSeq (cleaned, e.g. removal of partial genes).

Version 2.4.0, 02 Feb 2022
- Added function for additional eXtra random features under development "-x". To set up analysis of multiple .fastq files: prepare_miseq, prepare_nextseq, prepare_single.

Version 2.4.0, 25 Jan 2022
- Added parameters option for background nose removal based on minimum classified number of reads.

Version 2.3.0, 30 Nov 2021
- Corrected an issue in the singe-end data filtering script.
- Corrected an issue in the tRNAs and rRNAs filtering scripts.

Version 2.2.0, 08 July 2021
- Added RnaSeq mode and rRNA_tRNA database. When Rna Mode is active, reads are filtered for rRNA and tRNA and then processed as usual.

Version 2.1.7, 27 May 2021
- Tweaking of filtering pipeline. Introduced the primer filtering hidden feature (place a list of primers in a file named "primers_list.txt" to trigger their filtering from, sequences' edges).

Version 2.1.6, 20 May 2021
- Improved Host reads filtering. Switched to bwa and improved the databases.
