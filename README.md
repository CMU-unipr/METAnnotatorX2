METAnnotatorX2 is a bash script, so it doesnâ€™t need to be compiled. However, to perform a complete analysis, several extra programs are invoked by METAnnotatorX2. Most of the requested programs are included in the METAnnotatorX2 package, while additional dependencies, listed in the next paragraph, will be installed into the system together with METAnnotatorX2.
